# AWS EKS Kubernetes Project with Terraform,VPC and Github Actions CICD

This project provisions a secure, production grade Kubernetes platform on AWS to deploy and manage a containerised version of a NodeJs Web Application, all powered by Terraform, EKS, VPC and GitHub Actions. 
It showcases of the monolitic Architecture, cloud native architecture, CICD automation with Github Action, and modular infrastructure design.

## Features

- Lightweight, multi-stage Docker build for efficient containerisation
- Clearly seperated CI/CD workflows for plan, apply, and destroy stages
- Implemented Github Actions for CICD, Terraform For Infrastructure Deployment and Management  & rollback from Git
- Security â†’ IRSA least-privilege roles for in cluster controllers
